Pretraining techniques have been a cornerstone in the advancement of Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly with the increasing complexity and diversity of linguistic phenomena such as code-switching. In the realm of pretraining methods, there have been various approaches aimed at refining the process. Recent studies have questioned the universality of traditional masked language modeling (MLM) objectives, proposing simpler yet effective alternatives. For example, one paper suggests [1] five token-level classification tasks as potential substitutes for MLM, which is particularly relevant for enhancing pretraining methods for code-switched NLP. Electra [2] introduces a more sample-efficient pre-training task called replaced token detection, signifying a step forward in the pursuit of effective pretraining techniques for code-switched languages. The impact of different masking rates on the efficiency of MLM pre-training is also scrutinized [3], providing insights into the optimal masking rate, especially for larger models. Furthermore, the idea of adaptive tuning of the masking ratio and the content being masked is explored [4], presenting a dynamic approach to pretraining that could significantly benefit code-switched NLP.

The interplay between code-switching and translation is another area that significantly influences the pretraining of NLP models. The challenges and strategies inherent in translating code-mixed languages are highlighted in a study on English to Hinglish translation [5], which also assesses the impact of expanding input data using parallel monolingual sentences. This underscores the potential of utilizing pretraining models more effectively in the context of code-switching. The scarcity of parallel training data for code-mixed languages has led researchers to explore data augmentation strategies [6], enhancing the training of models for code-mixed translation and directly relating to the effective pretraining strategies under resource constraints. Additionally, the generation of high-quality code-switched text [7] is gaining interest due to the limited availability of code-switched corpora. Through the adaptation of neural machine translation models, this work contributes to the creation of synthetic code-switched text, aligning with the objectives of improving pretraining techniques for code-switched NLP.

The effectiveness and evaluation of code-switched NLP tasks are crucial for understanding the practical applications of pretraining techniques. A benchmark for evaluating code-switched languages across multiple NLP tasks [8] provides an effective resource for assessing various techniques, including those proposed in this paper. The interaction of code-mixing with multilingual BERT models is investigated [9], offering insights into how pretrained models can be fine-tuned with different types of code-mixed data. This finding is instrumental in enhancing the responsivity of models to code-mixed inputs. Furthermore, techniques to improve code-switched natural language understanding tasks are proposed [10], with bilingual intermediate pretraining showing significant performance gains. These techniques, including a code-switched MLM pretraining technique, are consistent with the primary objective of this work, which focuses on improving pretraining for code-switched NLP tasks.

In summary, the body of research discussed here provides a broad landscape of current methods and challenges in pretraining for code-switched NLP. The insights and methodologies from these papers form the backbone of the advancements proposed in the present study, which seeks to further the capabilities of NLP models in handling the complexities of code-switching.
