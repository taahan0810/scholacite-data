Introduction to Humor Understanding in AI
Understanding humor involves different areas like language, psychology, and social studies. It's important to look at various studies to understand the challenges AI faces in recognizing and creating humor. Key works include studies on how humor uses language ([1]), the basics of humor in linguistics ([2]), and its psychological aspects, like the connection between jokes and our unconscious ([5]) and humor as a way to feel free psychologically ([7]). Social impacts of humor are also discussed ([4]). For a wider view, some works explore humor's philosophy ([8], [9]), its development in our minds ([10]), and how to analyze humor in texts ([15]).

Humor Recognition Across Modalities

Previous work in humor recognition has studied textual humor [11], including dialogues [12], [13]. Additionally, there is recent work from a multimodal perspective leveraging visual cues. [19] explored how to understand and predict visual humor by analyzing abstract scenes. [21] provides a multimodal dataset for understanding humor not only through words, but also gestures and prosodic cues. [22] found that combining text and video data over single modality approaches was effective for predicting laughter in sitcoms. [23] proposes a Humor Knowledge enriched Transformer model that integrates external knowledge. [24] and [25] analyze humor in comic strips from a multimodal perspective. Sarcasm has been studied by [20]. However, the subtlety of contextual humor, especially when interlaced with figurative language [26], remains a significant obstacle. Models struggle to grasp the semantic depth required for a comprehensive understanding, despite attempts to leverage advanced neural networks and multimodal approaches, as further explored in studies like [27] and [28], which demonstrate the potential of fine-tuned language models and BERT sentence embeddings in enhancing humor recognition.

Advancements and Challenges in Humor Generation

The automation of humor generation has seen some progress through templated approaches ([31]) and neural models [33], [34], [36], [37]. [30] and [32] provide insights into the effectiveness of computational models in generating and recognizing humor. These systems aim to mimic human-like humor but often fall short in capturing the essence of humor's emotive and meaningful impact. Evaluating humor beyond context-free metrics remains a challenge, highlighting the gap between computational humor generation and human creativity [17], [29], [39]. [35] and [38] offer innovative approaches to generate witty content and internet memes from news articles, respectively.

Towards a Deeper Understanding of Humor

[14], [24], and [25] propose sophisticated models that attempt to dissect the intricacies of humor through semantic analysis and structural understanding. However, generating coherent explanations and appreciating humor's contextual nuances still present substantial hurdles for AI [40], [41], [42]. The integration of active learning and symbolic representations, as suggested by our proposed AI framework, aims to address these challenges by focusing on the contextual nuances central to authentic humor appreciation, thereby advancing the state of humor understanding in AI as outlined by the foundational works of [16] and [18].
