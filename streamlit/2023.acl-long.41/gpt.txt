Understanding humor is a complex undertaking that traverses various domains such as linguistics, psychology, and social sciences. The foundational theories and insights from the field of humor research are essential to contextualize the challenges faced by AI in the task of humor recognition and generation. A selection of seminal works provides a multidisciplinary perspective essential for the current study. The linguistic mechanisms that humor operates on are outlined in [1], offering a crucial framework for semantic analysis. Building on this, [2] introduces the linguistics of humor, laying the groundwork for systematic linguistic inquiry. The psychological underpinnings are further explored in [5], which examines the relationship between jokes and the unconscious, while [7] discusses humor as a psychological liberation agent. The social dimensions are critiqued in [4], examining humor's societal implications. A broader overview of humor research, including its philosophical perspectives, is provided by [8] and [9], respectively. Comprehensive discussions on humor's cognitive-developmental aspects are found in [10], and the textual analysis of humor is enriched by insights from [15].

The role of humor in dialogues and cartoons is explored through a collection of studies focusing on the interaction between textual and visual elements. The effectiveness of computational models in identifying humorous captions is a key point in [11], which is vital for understanding textual humor recognition. The contextual humor in collective discourse is further examined in [12] and [13], which explore annotation and automated funniness detection. The importance of datasets for humor research is underscored by [18], while [24] and [25] contribute theories on multimodal humor and verbal-visual analysis in cartoons.

The utilization of AI in humor recognition and generation presents innovative methodologies that could be adapted for the tasks in the work-in-progress. The design of computational models to understand visual humor is aligned with the theme of the work and is discussed in [19]. Multimodal sarcasm detection is explored in [20], and the UR-FUNNY dataset introduced in [21] provides resources for understanding multimodal humor. The concept of adding laughter tracks to sitcoms is automated in [22], demonstrating an application of humor generation using AI. The multimodal approach to understanding humor is further investigated in [23], while language model fine-tuning for humor recognition is presented in [27]. The BERT embeddings for humor detection in [28] and the model of punning riddles in [30] exemplify AI's capacity to grasp different forms of humor. The development of computational humor for electronic commerce applications in [31] and the general investigations in automatic humor recognition in [32] outline the challenges and potential solutions in the AI domain. The creative use of AI to generate humor is illustrated by [33], [34], [36], and [37], while [39] offers a comprehensive survey of computational humor generation systems.

The role of crowdsourcing and active learning is critical when gathering annotations and rankings for humor analysis. The algorithm presented in [16] is particularly relevant to the work-in-progress for data gathering in large-scale crowdsourcing environments. Active learning methods and systems for their development and evaluation are discussed in [17], which can facilitate the collection of informative samples for machine learning models.

The generation and understanding of explanations, particularly within the context of humor, are of paramount concern. The challenge of understanding figurative language and explicating textual humor is tackled in [26]. The types and limitations of human-generated explanations, which can inform AI models attempting to explain humor, are discussed in [40]. Further insights into the structure and function of explanations are provided by [41], while the potential for leveraging large language models for explanation generation is presented in [42].

Lastly, the semantic and linguistic tools necessary for understanding humor are highlighted in [14], which describes the WordNet lexical database. The evaluation of computational humor generators is the focus of [29], while the method for automatically generating memes from news articles in [38] showcases a practical application of the text-to-image matching technology. These resources and methodologies serve as critical components for advancing the semantic and linguistic understanding required for AI to "understand" humor.
