Addressing Data Scarcity in Machine Translation

The pursuit of effective machine translation for low-resource languages confronts the significant barrier of scarce high-quality parallel corpora. Efforts to address these limitations have seen [1] evaluating multilingual models across languages, showing meaningful translation quality improvements with limited data. The exploration of multilingual translation techniques by [19], [20], and [21] has highlighted the efficacy of shared attention mechanisms and the potential of moving beyond English-centric models to enhance performance for low-resource languages. The contributions of [7], [8], and [10] further contextualize the landscape of data scarcity, underscoring the strategic creation of corpora and the nuanced challenges of scaling efforts across numerous language pairs. The research presented in [2] introduces valuable resources for Arabic dialects, enriching the diversity of available data and opening new avenues for machine translation research, particularly in the context of dialectology and dialect identification. Together, these studies emphasize the importance of innovative model architectures and multilingual strategies in overcoming data constraints.

The Value of High-Quality Data

High-quality, professionally translated datasets play a crucial role in machine translation for low-resource languages, as demonstrated by [11], [12], [13], and [14]. These works collectively illustrate the significant performance boosts achievable with a limited amount of high-quality translations, advocating for a focus on quality over quantity. The indispensable role of high-quality data in achieving practical translation outcomes is further supported by [24], which outlines both challenges and solutions in building translation systems for a vast array of languages. This narrative is enriched by insights from [3], [5], [6], and [9], which highlight the challenges of maintaining consistency across different domains, tasks, and evaluation benchmarks, and the imperative to address the translation needs of low-resource languages with human-centered approaches.

Leveraging Monolingual Data and Innovative Training Techniques

The exploitation of monolingual data through backtranslation and self-supervision presents a promising avenue for augmenting training materials for machine translation models. Studies [15], [16], [17], and [18] delve into the power of backtranslation and self-supervision, showcasing their potential to improve translation models by generating synthetic parallel data. However, the issues of propagated errors and computational constraints in mass augmentation [18] are acknowledged, indicating the complexity of effectively leveraging monolingual resources. The advancements in model scaling and training techniques proposed in [22] offer a promising direction for enhancing translation quality through deep Transformers, further supporting the potential of innovative training approaches.

Multilingual and Crisis Response Translation Efforts

The role of machine translation in crisis response and multilingual translation is underscored by [4], [25], and [26], highlighting the urgent need for rapid development and deployment of translation systems to facilitate effective communication during emergencies. These efforts demonstrate the translation community's capacity to address immediate needs in crisis situations, emphasizing the necessity for agility and efficiency in developing solutions. The challenges of tailoring systems to specific, unfolding situations where training data may be lacking are acknowledged, illustrating the broader implications and societal benefits of quick-response MT systems.

Our work seeks to investigate meticulously compiled bitexts for low-resource languages, aiming to demonstrate the primacy of quality over quantity in translation efforts. By focusing on small, high-quality datasets and reducing reliance on data augmentation, this study contributes to the ongoing dialogue on balancing data efficiency, quality, and model performance in machine translation. The inclusion of previously omitted references [23], [21], [10], and [22] enhances the discussion around strategic corpus creation, the challenges of multilingual model performance parity, and the innovative scaling of Transformers, offering a more comprehensive view of the current challenges and potential solutions in the field.
