Compositional Modeling and Semantic Parsing

The exploration of compositionality in language processing has unveiled critical insights into how language components interact to form coherent meanings. The concept, foundational to understanding language's hierarchical nature, is exemplified through various approaches. The Hiero machine translation system [1] underscores the significance of hierarchical structures in enhancing machine translation's performance, setting a precedent for subsequent models. This hierarchical emphasis is complemented by the phrase-based translation model introduced by [2], which empirically demonstrates the superiority of phrase-based over word-based models, attributing high performance to heuristic learning and lexical weighting of phrase translations. The balance between model capacity and computational efficiency is further refined in neural semantic parsers, as illustrated by [3], which achieves comparable performance to more computationally intensive models through a shift-reduce CCG semantic parsing approach. The integration of data recombination techniques [14] further advances semantic parsing by injecting crisp logical regularities into neural models, leading to new state-of-the-art performance on key datasets. These works underscore the ongoing challenges in achieving compositional generalization, a theme that resonates with our investigation into lexical symmetry and compositionality, and the quest for models that can handle both natural language variation and compositional generalization [15].

Neural Machine Translation

In the realm of neural machine translation, the limitations of fixed context vectors and the struggle to accurately translate rare words are addressed through innovative solutions. The work of [4] extends the basic encoder-decoder architecture to allow for dynamic alignment, marking a significant advancement in neural machine translation by addressing the bottleneck of fixed-length vectors. This is further supported by efforts to enhance lexicon learning for sequence modeling [5], and the introduction of pointer-generator transformers [6], which collectively address the critical issue of translating rare words. The integration of external experts, as detailed by [7], offers a novel approach to one-shot learning for rare-word translation, illustrating the diverse strategies employed to overcome neural machine translation challenges. Our approach to enhancing neural translation leverages these insights, particularly focusing on the potential of symmetry-driven data augmentation to improve lexical coverage and compositionality.

Data Augmentation and Lexicon Learning

The advancements in data augmentation and lexicon learning are pivotal in extending neural models' capabilities. Techniques ranging from lexical mechanisms [5] to the innovative use of pointer-generators [6] and expert interaction [7] have significantly contributed to the field. Furthermore, the exploration of counterfactual data augmentation [16], the efficient SwitchOut algorithm [17], and easy data augmentation techniques [18] reflect the ongoing effort to refine data augmentation strategies for boosting performance on text classification tasks. These methodologies not only enhance lexical coverage but also facilitate the learning of balanced representations, aligning closely with our focus on leveraging data symmetry to improve compositional generalization.

Representation Learning and Compositional Generalization

The quest for compositional generalization has led to significant insights into representation learning. The measurement of compositionality in representation learning [8], alongside investigations into the capacity and bandwidth's impact on emergent language learning [9], underpins the importance of understanding linguistic biases and their effects. The exploration of permutation equivariant models [11] and equivariant transduction [12] provides valuable perspectives on achieving compositional generalization. The understanding of linguistic evolution through visualizing the emergence of topographic mappings [10] and the comparison of strategies for learning from imbalanced data sets [13] contribute to our comprehension of the complex dynamics of language learning and evolution. These studies collectively highlight the challenges in handling natural language variation and systematic generalization, themes central to our work with LEXSYM, where we aim to harness symmetries in data distributions to enhance model generalization capabilities.
