Our work is grounded in markedness, a concept originally referring to mentioning some grammatical features more explicitly than others; for example, plural nouns in English are marked by ending with -s while singular nouns are unmarked (have no suffix). Markedness was extended to non-grammatical concepts by [1] and then to social categories such as gender and race by [2], who noted that masculinity tends to be the unmarked default for gender and that in US texts, White people are typically referred to without mention of race, while non-Whites are often racially labeled ([3]; [4]; [5], inter alia).

Hence we use markedness to mean that those in dominant groups tend to be linguistically unmarked (i.e, referred to without extra explanation or modification) and assumed as the default, while non-dominant groups are marked (linguistically and socially) by their belonging to these groups. Markedness is thus inextricable from the power dynamics of white supremacy and patriarchy ([6]; [7], inter alia): stereotypes and perceptions of essential differences between minorities and the unmarked majority only further entrench these power differentials ([8]).

In line with previous work, we define stereotypes as traits that have been documented to be broadly associated with a demographic group in ways that reify existing social hierarchies ([9]; [10]; [11]; [12]; [13]). Various methods have been developed to measure social bias and stereotypes in large language models ([14]; [15]; [16]; [17]; [18]; [19]; [20]; [21], inter alia). [22] compare these methods, finding that they satisfy at most 3 of 5 desiderata. Marked Personas improves upon these by satisfying 4 of the 5 desiderata: it generalizes to new demographic groups, is grounded in social science theory, uses natural-language LLM inputs, and captures specific stereotypes (Appendix A). We do not satisfy exhaustiveness: rather than exhaustively characterizing the full range of stereotypes, we characterizes dataset-specific patterns in portrayals of different demographics. Marked Personas enables us to capture specific stereotypes even as they are culturally dependent and constantly evolving ([23]; [24]).

Marked Personas also captures patterns for intersectional groups. Intersectionality refers to the notion that systems of oppression like sexism and racism are interrelated, and thus multifaceted social identities can be loci of compounding bias and unique harms ([25]; [26]; [27]). We build upon previous work on intersectional biases in word embeddings and LMs ([28]; [29]; [22]), as well as for specific topics: [30] examine intersectionality in toxicity tasks, while others have constructed measurements for the “Angry Black Woman” stereotype and occupational biases ([31]; [19]).
